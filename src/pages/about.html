      <h2 class="cs-title">About Southwest Michigan Roofing & Construction</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Southwest Michigan Roofing & Construction was officially founded in July
        2023, but its roots go deeper. Originally launched under a different
        name as a general construction company, the business was started by a
        dedicated father-and-son team committed to honest work and reliable
        service. Over time, we shifted our focus toward what we do
        best—residential roofing, siding, and exterior construction throughout
        Kalamazoo, Portage, and surrounding Michigan communities.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Backed by a team of highly skilled professionals with years of industry
        experience, we’ve spent time working as trusted subcontractors for
        established contractors. Today, we're taking our own name to the
        forefront—building our brand, earning recognition, and bringing top-tier
        craftsmanship directly to homeowners and property managers across
        Southwest Michigan.
      </p>
      <div class="cs-flex-group">
        <p class="cs-flex-p">
          We're a locally owned and operated business driven by strong values,
          quality results, and long-term client relationships. Our marketing is
          led by a Michigan State University Construction Management student,
          blending hands-on construction knowledge with forward-thinking digital
          strategies. With a growing online presence and a crew that delivers on
          every promise, we’re confident in one thing—we’re just getting
          started.

              1. How much does a roof replacement cost in Southwest Michigan?
            </span>
            <span class="cs-indicator" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Roof replacement pricing depends on your roof size, material
            (asphalt shingles, metal), roof pitch and complexity, and whether a
            full tear-off is required. After a free on-site inspection, we
            provide a detailed, written estimate. Many single-family homes in
            the Kalamazoo and Portage area fall between $8,000–$20,000, but your
            project may be outside this range based on scope. We’ll price your
            roof transparently and answer every question.

              2. Do you help with insurance claims for storm, wind, or hail
              damage?
            </span>
            <span class="cs-indicator" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Yes. Our team assists with storm-damage assessments, documentation
            and photos, meeting your adjuster, and providing a professional
            scope of repair. We help you navigate the process so approved
            repairs are completed to code with minimal out-of-pocket costs
            beyond your deductible.

            <span class="cs-indicator" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Most residential roof replacements in Southwest Michigan are
            completed in 1–2 days once scheduled. Larger homes, complex roofs,
            or weather delays can extend the timeline to 3–5 days. We protect
            your property during the project and perform a full cleanup at the
            end of each day.

          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            We install architectural asphalt shingles, metal roofing, and
            solutions for low-slope areas. We’ll recommend options that fit your
            budget, enhance curb appeal, and perform well in Michigan’s
            freeze–thaw cycles, wind, and seasonal storms.

            Every installation includes a workmanship warranty from Southwest
            Michigan Roofing & Construction along with manufacturer material
