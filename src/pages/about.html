      <h2 class="cs-title">About Southwest Michigan Roofing & Construction</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Southwest Michigan Roofing & Construction was officially founded in July
        2023, but its roots go deeper. Originally launched under a different
        name as a general construction company, the business was started by a
        dedicated father-and-son team committed to honest work and reliable
        service. Over time, we shifted our focus toward what we do
        best—residential roofing, siding, and exterior construction throughout
        Kalamazoo, Portage, and surrounding Michigan communities.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Backed by a team of highly skilled professionals with years of industry
        experience, we’ve spent time working as trusted subcontractors for
        established contractors. Today, we're taking our own name to the
        forefront—building our brand, earning recognition, and bringing top-tier
        craftsmanship directly to homeowners and property managers across
        Southwest Michigan.
      </p>
      <div class="cs-flex-group">
        <p class="cs-flex-p">
          We're a locally owned and operated business driven by strong values,
          quality results, and long-term client relationships. Our marketing is
          led by a Michigan State University Construction Management student,
          blending hands-on construction knowledge with forward-thinking digital
          strategies. With a growing online presence and a crew that delivers on
          every promise, we’re confident in one thing—we’re just getting
          started.
